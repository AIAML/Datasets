# Text Classification
Text Classification is one of the machine learning techniques which has been used :
 - natural language processing
 - sentiment analysis
 -  spam & intent detection
 -  searching
 -  Organizing text(stories, papers)

## Feature selection in Text Categorization
Due to the high dimensionality of feature space.The performance of machine learning algorithms for the categorization of documents reduces. Feature selection is an important data preprocessing strategy.
